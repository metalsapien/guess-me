# guess-me
The ultimate guessing challenge!
# Rules:
1. Computer will randomly choose any number within the range 1-100.
2. You have too guess what number is it!
3. If you guess within 10 more or less, computer says 'WARM', else 'COLD'.
4. In your subsequent guesses, if you're moving closer to the number, computer says 'WARMER', else 'COLDER'.
