# guess-me
The ultimate guessing challenge!
# Rules:
1. Computer will randomly choose any number within the range 1-100.
2. You have to guess what number is it!
3. If you guess within 10 more or less, computer says 'WARM', else 'COLD'.
4. In your next guess(es), move closer to the number and computer says 'WARMER', else 'COLDER', until you get the number!
